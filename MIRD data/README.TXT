SETUP.EXE installs the RADTABS, its associated data files, and places the
RADTABS icon on the desktop. The default folder for the installation is
C:\MIRD07 but you can select or define a different folder. Accept the
defaults on the remaining questions. The installation will end with this
file being displayed and RADTABS invoked. The user guide can be viewed within
RADTABS by pressing the F6 key and selecting the guide. RADTABS can be
removed from the system by clicking the executable UNINS000.EXE in the MIRD07
folder.

I. Configuration topics

a. RADTABS Console Size.

The size of RADTABS' console window can be enlarged by selecting a font of 
larger size. To do this right click on the RADTABS icon on the desktop, select
Properties, click on the Font tab, and then select a font larger size. A 
different font type can be selected, e.g., Lucida Console font is a good 
alternative to the default font type because of its horizontal-vertical aspect
ratio. It will be necessary to experiment here as the ultimate font size depends
somewhat on the resolution of the monitor. So start small (e.g., Lucida Console 
font size 14) and move to larger sizes if so desired.

b. Size of RADTABS Plots.

RADTABS plots are generated by the DPlotJr module. The display can be re-sized 
in the manner of conventional Windows applications. Its default configuration 
is to start maximized. To set to a window of desired size first adjust the display
to the desired size (drag a corner), pull down the Options menu on the DPlotJr's 
toolbar, and un-select the item "Always start maximized'. DPlotJr will then start
at this size in the future.

c. Plot Display. 

If DPlotJr is to create more than one plot RABTABS directs it to display the
plots in a cascade manner. RADTABS will directed that the plots be maximizes
in the plot window if a file named DPlotJr.INI is place in the DATA folder. This
can be an empty file as RADTABS tests for the file existence not its content. To
view the plots use the Windows menu on DPlotJr's toolbar.

d. Display of Documents/Files

During a RADTABS session, files generated and documents in the REPORT folder
can be displayed. The display of these files is based on the user having 
designated files with extension TXT for display by MS NotePad (or an ASCII
editor) and files with extension PDF displayed by Adobe Reader.

II. Content of CD

For information on the content of the CD see CONTENT.PDF. A copy of this document
can be found in the REPORT folder (access from RADTABS by Help, F6 key) on the
CD.
