This archive folder contains the main output file generated by EDISTR04 for 
the nuclides of the MIRD-07 collection. Note in some cases, data for the decay
of both the ground and metastable states of the nuclide are included in a
single file; e.g., Tc99.OUT included Tc-99m and Tc-99. The information bracketed
by OUTPSTAR and OUTPEND (columns 73-80 and 73-79, respectively) were used to
prepare the printed tables. This information is included in the archive folder
TABLES to easier access.
