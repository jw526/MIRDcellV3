This archive folder contains the characteristic x-ray data in the notation of 
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). See Appendix A 
of JAERI1347.PDF (in the REPORT folder of RADTABS) for translation to the 
conventional Siegbahn notation. Note multiple daughter nuclei result in duplicate
transitions of different energies. These data are included in the RAD file and 
were included in the printed tables to the extent the line survived the cutoff on
the number of photon emissions listed. Tha associated Auger-CK electron grouped
data are in the archive folder AUGER.
