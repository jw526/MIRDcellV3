                                   Auger-CK Groups

This archive folder contains the Auger and Coster-Kronig electron group data which were
tabulated in the monograph. See Table A.2 of Appendix A of JAERI1347.PDF (in the REPORT
folder of RADTABS) for the definitions of the notation. Note multiple daughter nuclei
result in duplicate transitions with same notation but different energies. These data are
included in the RAD file and were included in the printed tables to the extent they survived
the cutoff on the number of electron emissions listed. The associated characteristic x-ray 
data are in the archive folder X-RAY.
