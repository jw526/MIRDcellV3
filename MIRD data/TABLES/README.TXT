This archive folder contains the ASCII files used to create the printed 
tables of the monograph. These files, extracted from the EDISTR04's 
output, see OUTPUT folder, are provided to facilitate access to the 
abridged data. However, it is not apparent why one would not simply
use the unabridged data (MIRD07.*) of this CD.
